Build System:

Right now the build system consists of the main "top-level" Makefile and scripts
within the "scripts/" directory to match each target. This handles downloading sources
on-the-fly, compiling them, and installing them to the output directory "root/" to be
tested in chroot use. This was the only way I could wrap my brain around getting it work
while still being neat. I am still new to make and this is a one-man project.
